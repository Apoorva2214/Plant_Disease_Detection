# Plant Disease Detection App

This repository contains the code for a Plant Disease Detection App, a machine learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect various plant diseases from images. This app aims to help farmers and gardeners quickly identify and address plant health issues.

## Features

- *Image Classification:* Detects and classifies plant diseases from photos.
- *CNN Model:* Utilizes a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- *Data Preprocessing:* Includes scripts for cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
- *Web Interface:* A web server that provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and predicting images.
- *Image Processing:* Incorporates OpenCV for advanced image handling and processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV

### Installation

Clone the repository:
\\\`bash
git clone https://github.com/Apoorva2214/Plant_Disease_Detection
cd plant-disease-detection-app
\\\`

Install the required packages:
\\\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\\\`

### Usage

1. *Train the Model:*
   - Use the \Plant_Disease_Prediction_CNN_Image_Classifier.ipynb\ notebook to preprocess data and train the CNN model.

2. *Run the Web Server:*
   - Execute \main.py\ to start the web server.

3. *Predict Disease:*
   - Upload plant images through the web interface and get instant disease predictions.

## Model Training

The \Plant_Disease_Prediction_CNN_Image_Classifier.ipynb\ notebook contains detailed steps for:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Building and training the CNN model
- Evaluating model performance
- Saving the trained model
